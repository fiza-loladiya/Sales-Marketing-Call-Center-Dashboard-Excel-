## Quick Preview

![Dashboard Overview](Dashboard%20Overview.png)


### Business Context
A Sales & Marketing call center was handling a high volume of calls.  
The team needed a clear view of performance to understand:
- How many calls are successful, failed, or abandoned
- Which agents perform best
- What products customers discuss the most
- Why calls fail or get abandoned
- Monthly trends for planning and improvements

### My Responsibility
My task was to create an Excel dashboard that is:
- Easy for managers to use (no complex steps)
- Filterable by agent (so they can review one agent at a time)
- Insight-driven (clear KPIs + reasons + trends)
- Professional and ready for reporting

### What I Did
**1) Data Understanding & Preparation**
- Worked with a call-level dataset (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024)
- Checked data quality (missing values, inconsistent text, duplicates)
- Standardized key fields where required (example: reasons for unsuccessful calls)

**2) KPI & Metrics Design**
Built key metrics to summarize performance:
- Total Calls
- Successful Calls + Success %
- Failed Calls + Failure %
- Abandoned Calls + Abandoned %
- Average Call Duration
- Average Agent Rating

**3) Dashboard Build (Excel)**
- Created a clean dashboard layout with clear KPI cards and charts
- Added an **Agent filter/slicer** to analyze performance for a specific agent
- Built visuals for:
  - Monthly call trends
  - Agent comparison
  - Product discussed distribution
  - State/location distribution
  - Reasons for unsuccessful/abandoned calls

**4) Insight Layer**
- Highlighted top products discussed
- Identified common failure/abandon reasons (example: technical issues, long wait time)
- Made the dashboard easy to use for quick decisions

### Impact
This dashboard makes call center reporting faster and clearer by:
- Showing overall performance (success/failure/abandoned) in one view
- Helping managers identify top-performing agents and improvement areas
- Revealing top reasons for call drop/failure to fix operational issues
- Supporting monthly planning using trend analysis
